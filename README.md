The program was built for visualising the steps taken by a programming language interpretor to execute code.
It contains:
- Program states (allows multithreading)
- Execution stacks (individual for each thread)
- Symbol table (individual for each thread)
- Heap table (shared between all threads)
- Open files table 
- Output table
